These scripts add hydrocarbon chains to the Au201 particles.

First, a hydrocarbon chain of repeating unit length n must be made using build_HC_chain.py

Next, that chain may be grafted to the nanoparticle using build.py

	this is done in a few steps:
	add polymer chains to hexagonal faces from specific Au atoms
	add polymer chains to square faces from geometric sites

***Ensure that the particle and the chain have the same distance scale before grafting***
