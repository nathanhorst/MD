Take an existing particle and add polymers to it:

	add.py will add polymers of a specified length to the NP
	starting from atoms of the NP which are a specific distance
	from the origin and moving radially outward in a straight line

	add_poly.py is the script called upon the build the particles, and
	would need to modified to build appropriate atom types if other 
	polymers are desired

After add.py, the user must enter the xyz file and add the
appropriate number of atoms to the first line, as the program does not do this
automatically
