# MD_Scripts

Compilation of python scripts used to build, initialize and analyze systems for molecular dynamics simulations.

Three main subdirectories:

Build --  build lattices
          truncate lattices into nanoparticles
          add polymers onto the particles
          pack particles into a box for simulation

Convertfiles -- convert files between formats necessary for packmol, HOOMD, etc.

Analysis -- Scripts designed to analyze the results of MD runs
